# Fork Info

This is a forked version of the original [`ThuThesis`](https://github.com/tuna/thuthesis) repository. It aims to provide a more catered (or *simplified* to some extent) version of the template for the sake of personalized usage. It will be modified to better fit the needs of daily working and studying, for instance, course paper. Nevertheless, this template is usually implemented in Chinese, and paper to be written in English may use somthing else as its template.

> [!NOTE]
> For the formal use of a thesis template, you may return to use the original template of [`ThuThesis`](https://github.com/tuna/thuthesis).
